worked on a similar domain list ordering task, now for the cart project, again for ES brands. these tasks are impossible to validate currently, since the frontend of the site will only change when the API adjusts to these new parameters i have set. since homolog hits prod API, it might take a while.

started a task to create a cookie that store domain information to be passed through to the cart from mainsite. used js-cookie library. first time working with cookies, but looks intuitive, let's see how long this takes.

updates on https://phived.com, my personal project. chose vite instead of CRA. got started with overall repo config and architecture decisions. it is an anti-procrastination to-do list. a simple project, but it will bring value. to me and others. info + code: https://github.com/LukeberryPi/phived

got pretty harsh feedback on 1:1. i'm producing half of what is expected of me, and doing a poor job at documenting my processes. asked to be more attentive toward deploys as well. rough days.

sprint start. q1sp5. i documented my losing fight to an input, part of the ecommerce register forms. should have been done mid-afternoon according to story points estimation. created a second task and commented my shortcomings on the old one. reattributed story points to increase rastreability of my work.
