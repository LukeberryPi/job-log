worked on a similar domain list ordering task, now for the cart project, again for ES brands. these tasks are impossible to validate currently, since the frontend of the site will only change when the API adjusts to these new parameters i have set. since homolog hits prod API, it might take a while.

started a task to create a cookie that store domain information to be passed through to the cart from mainsite. used js-cookie library. first time working with cookies, but looks intuitive, let's see how long this takes.

updates on https://phived.com, my personal project. chose vite instead of CRA. got started with overall repo config and architecture decisions. it is an anti-procrastination to-do list. a simple project, but it will bring value. to me and others. info + code: https://github.com/LukeberryPi/phived

got pretty harsh feedback on 1:1. i'm producing half of what is expected of me, and doing a poor job at documenting my processes. asked to be more attentive toward deploys as well. rough days.

sprint start. q1sp5. i documented my losing fight to an input, part of the ecommerce register forms. should have been done mid-afternoon according to story points estimation. created a second task and commented my shortcomings on the old one. reattributed story points to increase rastreability of my work.

most of the day on the input still. the challenge is to allow for the user to add leading, trailing and even redundant spaces between firstName and lastName(s) without showing an error message ever. this involved updating the name validator regex. the problem was that you cant trim the input onChange, otherwise the field disallows adding a space between first and last name. additionally, it has to be sent to the api trimmed, the same way as before.

worked on a redesign of a plan section on the ecommerce project. had to be mindful of: only the home page section had to be changed, but it contains cards that are present at another similar section, on the plans page. added the necessary content and struggled with react-slick + padding pixel-sized imperfections between my page and the presented figma.
