monday
2023-01-02

first monday of the year. two big lessons: using absolute positioning is a bad idea
and a focused 2-hour session on Monday is more productive than the entire Friday
afternoon. finished developing the step by step component on a new company project
after being stuck since last year. flexboxes, flexboxes everywhere.


tuesday
2023-01-03

a ghost from the past took away most of my day. minor content adjustments from an older task to be deployed tomorrow. reduced scope so it could get through in time. started
developing a dropdown component for the new company project. negotiated working hours for
tomorrow, since i'll be travelling back to florianopolis.


wednesday
2023-01-04

nothing but buses, traffic, uber and planes. thought i'd be able to work a few hours in the afternoon, but i arrived too late.


thursday
2023-01-05

continued development of select component (renamed from dropdown). had a hard time
typing an onClick function in React + TypeScript. FormEvent and MouseEvent lead to "no overload matches this call". called for help, we couldn't get around it and opted for a cheeky any + eslint disable.


friday
2023-01-06

spent time styling an refactoring the select component. got familiar with passing onClick functions as props to react components. onClick && onClick(). created state for isOpen, as well as logic for toggling onClick and handleOutsideClick + eventListener. sent PR.
