had a townhall meeting where the CEO presented the new project my squad has been working on to
the entire company: we acquired it is an ecommerce builder company (dlojavirtual.com). i am happy
to see the acquisition, being that many other companies are doing hardcore layoffs and slowing
down, it seems that we are expanding.

spent most of my day asking and understanding the PHP code on the email task, and how it relates
to WHMCS. got some tips, but could only accomplish it after a 5 min call with a senior. as it is
a different project and language, i don't feel too bad. ended up making the code correct and more
simple. big win.

spent my morning solving issues with my PHP PR. i didn't have the permissions to push any code to
this repo. my senior gave me permissions, still nothing. contacted devOps, and it was a local issue. 
solved by > sudo chown ${USER} -R on the correct directory. meeting combo: monthly engineering
meetup + gator class, where people share updates on their projects and technology choices. solved
two simple tasks. i currently feel more productive at the office than at home.
